# God-s-mini-projects


Hello, my name is God. This repository contains mini projects I developed during my early journey with Python. While some code may have mistakes, I'm continuously working on improving my skills.

A few of the projects are incomplete or experimental, and I plan to upgrade and expand on some of them in the future.
